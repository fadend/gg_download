This Chrome extension provides basic functionality for downloading posts from a Google Group.

It's not available in the Chrome Web Store so you'll need to load the unpacked version, starting
from chrome://extensions.

After installing it, pin it to make it accessible.

Navigate to the index page of the Google Group you care about.

Click the icon for the extension to initiate a download of the listed posts.

They should appear in your "Downloads" folder as ".mhtml" files.

You can read more about this format here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML.

I have created this for a specific project and so will likely not develop it much beyond what I need,
but I hope you might find it useful too.
